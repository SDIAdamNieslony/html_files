%% Introduction
% With over 25 years of experience in the field of material fatigue, I am passionate 
% about sharing my theoretical and practical knowledge in strength of materials, 
% material testing, numerical calculations, and signal analysis. As an academic 
% teacher and industry consultant, I have developed comprehensive educational 
% materials and scripts on material fatigue. Most of them are typical presentations, 
% but there are also MATLAB scripts that help me present computational algorithms. 
% Hence the idea of creating a set of Live Scipts that contain theory and computational 
% code. Using these, I am happy to conduct seminars to expand your knowledge and 
% skills in this specialized field. Below you will find topics list that I offer 
% in my knowledge-building seminars.

%% 3 Multiaxial Fatigue
% In the case of multiaxial fatigue, it is important to understand the stress

% the type of multi-axial load is also important, i.e. when it is proportional 
% or non-proportional and what parameters describe these quantities. 
% 
% The most interesting are the multiaxial fatigue failure criteria, which have 
% their limitations as well as advantages and disadvantages. Critical plane approaches, 
% particularly Fatemi-Socie and SWT, dominate in practical applications due to 
% their versatility and alignment with real-world conditions. Simple criteria

% computational simplicity is prioritized. The choice in practice often depends 
% on computational resources, material behavior, and the complexity of loading.

% Multiaxial loading and multiaxial stress states are distinct concepts that

% component geometry and dynamic properties, necessary for accurate fatigue analysis. 
% We delve into the Finite Element Analysis (FEM) methodology of component analysis 
% to examine how specific loading conditions affect the stress state. Participants 
% will gain a clear understanding of how to define and calculate multiaxial fatigue 
% factors.
